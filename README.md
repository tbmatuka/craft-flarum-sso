# Flarum SSO for Craft 4

This is a fork of [burnthebook/craft-flarum-sso](https://github.com/Burnthebook/craft-flarum-sso) that I created for a project that uses emails as usernames.

## I DON'T PLAN ON MAINTAINING THIS PROJECT

I will maintain it for the project that I'm working on, but I have no intention of doing anything unless my project has a problem. You can use this package as-is, fork it and maintain your own package or try to upstream the changes (my IDE cleaned up whitespaces and other code style problems, so diffs will be a bit of a mess).
